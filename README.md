# Important
This repo es for demonstration purposes only. It only goes to show that you can add anyone to a repo as a collaborator, even without them having to know about it. You can find the details about this implementation in my blog post in Spanish [here](https://fredrare.com/post/aparentemente-hackeando-github/). In that article, you will be able to find out how to configure automatic signing of your commits in your machine.

## Disclaimer
Linus Torvalds is not a collaborator of this repo, but appears as such on the side bar.
